An idea literally isn't part of our world until we learn of it. It can affect us externally—shape us, even—but until the moment of contact, it isn't part of our world model. We constantly enter new worlds as new ideas find us. And then what? They live in our heads, maybe surface in a conversation, maybe get typed into a chat at 2 AM, and then they may dissolve. They become part of us without ever becoming part of anything else.

I've been thinking about what remains. Not in a morbid way—I'm optimistic about the future—but in a practical one. My thoughts, as they stand, are distributed across relationships, direct messages, and conversations with language models that may or may not feed them into the next generation of themselves. A strange form of accidental immortality. But it's scattered, contextual, and shaped by whoever I was talking to at the time.

I am not my relationships. I am not the persona I put on in the company of others. To them, maybe I am—and that's fine. We show distinct parts of ourselves to different people, some parts we like more than others. But a platform for pure expression is peculiar in that those limitations fall away. There's no audience to perform for, no dynamic to navigate. Just the thought itself.

So this is mainly that. A place to think out loud, with the possibility of looking back.

A place to think out loud, but not a place to settle. There's a version of this that goes wrong—where writing things down starts to feel like committing to them. Where you attach yourself too tightly to something and then lose interest, or it changes, and you can't relate to yourself anymore. You've built a house on ground that was always going to shift.

I've watched ideas do this to people. I've felt the pull myself. The quiet pressure to *be* the thing you're into, to belong to it. And belonging has a cost: you start filtering the world through whatever you've committed to, and you lose the peripheral vision. Both sides shadow-boxing in an empty room, convinced they're in a real fight.

I could easily let any one interest become the whole story. It's not just tribalism, though it can be. It's subtler than that.

So I'd rather keep things fuzzy around the edges.

The word I keep circling is *coherent*. Not coherent as in consistent—I hope to change my mind often, and publicly, and without apology. Changing your mind is a good sign. It means you're still in contact with the world. No, coherent as in *a record that holds together enough to show a trajectory*. Fuzzy at the edges, but with enough shape that you can see where the thinking moved.

There's a distinction worth making: between identifying with a stance, and the stance itself. I can write something down today and outgrow it by next year. It's merely a trail, instead of a monument, though wouldn't a monument be nice.

---

For now, the commitment is small. Maybe an hour on a Sunday morning, coffee, something forming on the screen. Not necessarily a post every week. Just time set aside for the practice of thinking deliberately. With sparks of something during the rest of the week as a bonus.

I'm talking to the void, and if the void talks back, nice. If it doesn't, the thoughts still exist somewhere outside my head now, and that's enough.
