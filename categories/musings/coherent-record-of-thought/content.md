An idea is literally not part of our world until we learn of it. It can affect us externally, but until the moment of contact, it isn't part of our world model. We constantly enter new worlds as new ideas find us. From then on, they live in our heads, occasionally surface in a conversation, but sometimes they dissolve. They become part of us without ever becoming part of anything else, but there is no record of it ever having been part of anything.

I want to take a moment to think about what remains. Not in a morbid way—I'm optimistic about the future—but in a practical one. My thoughts, as they stand, are distributed across relationships, direct messages, group chats, and conversations with language models that may or may not be fed into the next generation of such models. A strange form of accidental immortality. But it's scattered, contextual, and co-shaped by whoever I was talking to at the time, as well as the time itself.

I am not my relationships. I am not the persona I put on in the company of others. To them, maybe I am—and that's fine, and true in the way that matters to them. We show distinct parts of ourselves to different people, some parts we like more than others. But a platform for pure expression is peculiar in that those limitations fall away. There's ideally no audience to perform for, no dynamic to navigate. Just the thought itself.

So this is mainly that. A place to think out loud, with the prospect of looking back one day.

A place to think out loud, but not a place to settle. There's a version of this that goes wrong, where writing things down starts to feel like committing to them. Where you attach yourself too tightly to something and then lose interest, or it changes, and you can't relate to yourself anymore.

Kegan's model helps me name the risk. It's easy to stay in a socialized mode, where your thinking is quietly organized by the audience in front of you. If the room rewards certainty, you become certain. If the room rewards being the "X person," you become that. Writing can either reinforce that, or help move toward a self-authoring stance where beliefs are tools, not identity.

Storr makes a parallel point in *The Status Game*: status is always in the room, even when we pretend it's not. Ideas become badges. Positions become teams. A take can start as curiosity and end as scorekeeping. I've watched that happen, and I can do it too.

So I'd rather keep things fuzzy around the edges. Not vague, just unpossessed.

The word I want to emphasize is *coherent*. Not coherent as in chronically consistent—I hope to change my mind often, and publicly, without apology. Changing your mind is a good sign. It means you're still in contact with the world. No, coherent as in *a record that holds together enough to show a trajectory*. Fuzzy at the edges, but with enough shape that you can see where the thinking moved.

There's a distinction worth making: between identifying with a stance, and the stance itself. I can write something down today and outgrow it by next year. Although I hope I can keep enough substance and grounding so as to not require 180-degree turns. The records are a trail, not a set of monuments or milestones.

For now, commitment should be small but consistent. An hour on a Sunday morning. Not necessarily a post every week. Just time set aside for the practice of thinking deliberately, with occasional sprints of creativity being a bonus.

I'm talking to the void, and if the void talks back, cool. If it doesn't, the thoughts still exist somewhere outside my head now, and that's enough.
