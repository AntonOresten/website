The second episode of Futurama is called "The Series Has Landed". It has a double meaning—the crew lands on the Moon, and the show itself has landed. It exists now; it's here. The pilot did its job. Now what?

The episode is a joke about disappointment. Fry dreams of the Moon and gets Luna Park: souvenir stands, tacky attractions, fake wonder sold by the hour. The thing he longed for is real, but his first encounter is a commercialized imitation of it. The easy read is cynicism: everything meaningful gets flattened into content. But the episode doesn't stop there. Fry keeps going. He walks past the simulation and finds the quiet part. The joke is that the Moon became a theme park; the point is that the Moon is still there.

That feels close to writing online now. The medium is saturated with posture: brands pretending to be people, people pretending not to be brands, everyone aware of the performance while performing anyway. It's post-irony: saying something sincere while signaling you know sincerity is risky. Then meta-irony: signaling that you know you're signaling.

So what counts as sincerity in that environment? Maybe not "speaking without irony". That can become its own performance, too. Maybe sincerity is simpler and harder: staying with one thought for long enough. Or maybe sincerity is not even the target. Maybe what matters more is whether the writing is made in good faith, even when some of it stays implied. Irony still has a place in philosophical musing, but mostly as a tool. It can puncture grandiosity and mark uncertainty. But if irony is all you offer, nothing is at stake. Maybe that's why this episode feels right for an early post. "The Series Has Landed" is less about arrival than orientation: you step into a noisy space and try to locate the real surface beneath it. So yes, maybe this is blogslop, your honor. But it's useful blogslop if it keeps me moving past the performance and leaves a timestamp of what I actually thought.
